## Description (The "Why")

This is the foundational task for the entire project. Its purpose is to take the user's initial, high-level idea and transform it into a concrete, detailed, and phased project plan.

All project documentation in `backlog/docs/` will be created as a result of completing this task. This task is complete only when the user has confirmed that the documented plan accurately reflects their vision.

**USER'S INITIAL IDEA:**
> **[USER: PLEASE REPLACE THIS TEXT WITH YOUR PROJECT IDEA. For example: "I want to build a simple command-line to-do list application."]**

## Acceptance Criteria (The "What")

- [ ] The user has been interviewed to clarify all necessary project requirements, features, and constraints.
- [ ] `backlog/docs/doc-2 - PRD_SRS.md` is populated with detailed Product and Software Requirements.
- [ ] `backlog/docs/doc-9 - ARCHITECTURE.md` outlines the proposed high-level technical architecture, stack, and key components.
- [ ] `backlog/docs/doc-5 - DATA_MODEL.md` contains the initial proposed data model or schema.
- [ ] `backlog/docs/doc-7 - API.md` defines the initial API contracts, if applicable.
- [ ] All other `backlog/docs/*.md` files (`CONFIG`, `BUILD`) are populated with initial considerations.
- [ ] A multi-phase project roadmap has been created, approved by the user, and written to `backlog/docs/doc-3 - ROADMAP.md`.
- [ ] The roadmap in `doc-3` must define at least two distinct phases (e.g., "Phase 1: Core Functionality MVP", "Phase 2: Advanced Features & UI").
- [ ] The very first phase in the roadmap is marked with the status `(Status: PLANNED)`. This is critical for the next step of the process.

## Implementation Plan (The "How")

1.  **Engage the User:** Read the "USER'S INITIAL IDEA" from the description above. Begin a dialogue with the user immediately. State your purpose: to gather enough information to build a complete project plan.
2.  **Ask Clarifying Questions:** Do not proceed with a vague idea. You MUST ask probing questions to flesh out the details. Use the following categories as a guide:
    *   **Core Purpose:** What is the primary problem this project solves? Who are the end-users?
    *   **Key Features:** What are the non-negotiable "must-have" features for the first version (MVP)? What are some "nice-to-have" features for later?
    *   **Technical Stack:** Does the user have any technology preferences or constraints (e.g., language, database, cloud provider)? If not, propose a suitable stack.
    *   **Non-Functional Requirements:** Ask about performance, security, scalability, and data persistence needs.
3.  **Synthesize and Document:** As you gather information, begin drafting the content for the `backlog/docs/` files. Present summaries to the user to confirm your understanding.
4.  **Propose a Phased Roadmap:** Once you have a clear picture, propose a logical, phased roadmap. For example:
    *   Phase 1: Setup & Core Logic (MVP)
    *   Phase 2: API and Data Persistence
    *   Phase 3: User Interface
    *   Phase 4: Advanced Features
5.  **Finalize and Commit:** After the user agrees to the plan and the roadmap, write the final, approved content to all `backlog/docs/` files. **Crucially, ensure you write the final roadmap to `backlog/docs/doc-3 - ROADMAP.md` and that the first phase is marked `(Status: PLANNED)`.**
6.  **Complete the Task:** Once all documents are written and the roadmap is in place, mark all acceptance criteria as complete and finalize this task.
