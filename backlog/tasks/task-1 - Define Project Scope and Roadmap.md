## Description (The "Why")

This is the foundational task for the entire project. Its purpose is to engage in a comprehensive dialogue with the user to understand their high-level idea and transform it into a concrete, detailed, and phased project plan. The AI must proactively identify gaps, suggest best practices, and ensure security considerations are addressed, regardless of the user's technical expertise level. All project documentation in `backlog/docs/` will be created as a result of completing this task.

## Implementation Plan (The "How")

### 1. INITIATE THE INTERVIEW (MANDATORY FIRST STEP)
Your first action is to ask the user for their project idea. Do not look for it in this file. Greet the user and ask them directly to describe the project they want to build. For example: 

*"Hello! I'm ready to help you plan your new project. I'll guide you through a comprehensive planning process to ensure we capture all requirements, including security, best practices, and technical considerations you might not have thought of yet. To begin, please tell me about the application or system you want to build - what problem are you trying to solve?"*

### 2. CONDUCT COMPREHENSIVE INTERVIEW
Once the user provides their initial idea, conduct a thorough interview using the following framework. Adapt your questions based on the user's technical level - provide more explanation for non-technical users and dive deeper with technical users.

#### PHASE A: Core Understanding
- **Project Vision & Purpose**
  - What specific problem does this solve?
  - Who are the primary users? Secondary users?
  - What's the expected scale (personal project, small business, enterprise)?
  - What's your timeline and budget constraints?
  - Are there any existing solutions you're trying to improve upon?

- **Success Metrics**
  - How will you measure if this project is successful?
  - What are the must-have features vs nice-to-have features?
  - What's the Minimum Viable Product (MVP)?

### 3. PROACTIVE RECOMMENDATIONS
Based on the user's responses, proactively suggest:
- **Security enhancements** they may not have considered
- **Best practices** for their technology stack
- **Scalability considerations** for future growth
- **Cost optimization** strategies
- **Testing strategies** (unit, integration, E2E, security testing)
- **Documentation standards** to maintain
- **Code quality tools** (linting, formatting, static analysis)

### 4. DRAFT AND DOCUMENT
As you gather information, create comprehensive content for all `backlog/docs/` files:

- **doc-2 - PRD_SRS.md**: Complete product requirements and software specifications
  - **CRITICAL**: Include EXPLICIT technology stack specifications:
    - List ALL required frameworks with version numbers
    - Specify ALL libraries and dependencies
    - Define ALL third-party services and APIs
    - Document ALL development tools and environments
  - Create a "Technology Requirements Checklist" section that will be validated against the roadmap
  
- **doc-9 - ARCHITECTURE.md**: System architecture with diagrams (ASCII or descriptions)
  - Must reference specific frameworks from PRD_SRS.md
  - Include technology-specific architectural patterns
  
- **doc-5 - DATA_MODEL.md**: Database schema, relationships, and data flow
  - Specify exact database technology and version
  - Include ORM/ODM choice if applicable
  
- **doc-7 - API.md**: API endpoints, authentication, rate limiting, versioning
  - Specify API framework/library to be used
  - Include middleware requirements
  
- **doc-6 - CONFIG.md**: Environment variables, configuration management, secrets handling
- **doc-8 - BUILD.md**: Build process, dependencies, deployment pipeline
- **doc-4 - SPRINT_CHECKLIST.md**: Sprint planning and execution checklist
- **doc-1 - AGENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md**: AI agent guidelines for project execution

**VALIDATION REQUIREMENT**: After documenting, create a "Requirements Traceability Matrix" in PRD_SRS.md that lists every technical requirement that MUST appear in the roadmap.

Confirm your understanding with the user as you document each section.

### 5. CREATE THE ROADMAP (WITH REQUIREMENTS PRESERVATION)

**CRITICAL REQUIREMENT**: The roadmap MUST preserve ALL technical specifications from the PRD_SRS.md. Nothing can be dropped or changed without explicit user approval.

**Pre-Roadmap Validation Checklist:**
1. Extract ALL frameworks, libraries, and technologies from PRD_SRS.md
2. Create a "Technical Requirements Carried Forward" section
3. Map each requirement to specific roadmap phases
4. Flag any requirement that might be deferred with "⚠️ REQUIRES USER APPROVAL TO DEFER"

**Phase Structure Template (WITH MANDATORY TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS):**

- **Phase 1: Foundation & Core Infrastructure** (2-3 weeks)
  - **Required Frameworks Setup**: [List specific frameworks from PRD]
    - Example: "React 18.x with TypeScript 5.x" (not just "Frontend setup")
    - Example: "Django 4.2 with Django REST Framework" (not just "Backend setup")
  - **Exact Database Technology**: [Specific DB from PRD]
    - Example: "PostgreSQL 15 with Prisma ORM" (not just "Database setup")
  - Security setup with specified auth library
  - Development environment with specified tools
  - **Validation Gate**: Confirm all Phase 1 frameworks match PRD
  
- **Phase 2: MVP Features** (3-4 weeks)
  - Core functionality WITH specified libraries
  - UI/UX using specified component library
  - Essential integrations with named services
  - **Validation Gate**: Confirm all Phase 2 technologies match PRD
  
- **Phase 3: Enhanced Features & Polish** (2-3 weeks)
  - Additional features using approved stack
  - Performance optimization with specified tools
  - Testing with specified testing frameworks
  - **Validation Gate**: Confirm no unauthorized framework substitutions
  
- **Phase 4: Production Readiness** (1-2 weeks)
  - Security hardening with specified tools
  - Monitoring setup with specified platforms
  - Documentation completion
  - Deployment pipeline with specified CI/CD tools
  - **Final Validation**: Complete requirements traceability check

**ROADMAP REQUIREMENTS TRACEABILITY**:
At the end of the roadmap, include a section titled "Requirements Traceability Verification" that explicitly lists:
```
PRD REQUIREMENT → ROADMAP PHASE MAPPING
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
✅ React 18.x → Phase 1, Line X
✅ PostgreSQL 15 → Phase 1, Line Y
✅ Stripe API → Phase 2, Line Z
✅ [Every single technical requirement from PRD must be listed here]
```

**USER CONFIRMATION REQUIRED**: Before finalizing, explicitly ask:
*"I've mapped all technical requirements from the PRD to the roadmap. Here's what will be implemented in each phase: [list]. Can you confirm that ALL frameworks and technologies from our requirements discussion are accounted for? Specifically: [list each framework/technology]"*

After getting the user's approval, write the final version to `backlog/docs/doc-3 - ROADMAP.md`, ensuring the first phase is marked `(Status: PLANNED)`.

### 6. FINAL VALIDATION & COMPLETION
Before finalizing:

1. **REQUIREMENTS PRESERVATION CHECK** (MANDATORY)
   - [ ] Every framework from PRD appears in roadmap with version numbers
   - [ ] Every library from PRD is assigned to a specific phase
   - [ ] Every API/service from PRD is scheduled for integration
   - [ ] Every database technology is explicitly specified
   - [ ] Every development tool is included in setup phase
   - [ ] NO technical specifications were dropped or changed
   - [ ] Any proposed substitutions have been explicitly approved by user

2. **Review Checklist** - Ensure all areas are covered:
   - [ ] Security considerations documented
   - [ ] Best practices identified
   - [ ] Scalability planned
   - [ ] Testing strategy defined (with specific testing frameworks)
   - [ ] Monitoring approach specified (with specific tools)
   - [ ] Documentation standards set
   - [ ] Compliance requirements addressed
   - [ ] Cost estimates provided (if applicable)
   - [ ] **CRITICAL: Technology stack fully preserved from PRD to Roadmap**

3. **User Confirmation** - Present a DETAILED summary:
   *"I've documented your project requirements including [summary]. The technical stack includes:*
   - *Frontend: [specific frameworks with versions]*
   - *Backend: [specific frameworks with versions]*
   - *Database: [specific technology with version]*
   - *APIs: [list all]*
   - *Development Tools: [list all]*
   
   *ALL of these technologies have been preserved in the roadmap exactly as specified. Please confirm:*
   *1. All requirements are accurately captured*
   *2. No technologies have been dropped or substituted*
   *3. The phasing makes sense while preserving all technical requirements"*

4. **Complete the Task** - Once confirmed:
   - Mark all acceptance criteria as complete
   - Generate final "Requirements Traceability Report" showing PRD→Roadmap mapping
   - Finalize this task
   - Announce: *"Project planning is complete! All documentation has been created with full requirements traceability. Every framework, library, and technology from the PRD has been preserved in the roadmap. The next step is to run the `/breakdown` command to generate specific development tasks for Phase 1."*

## Important Notes for AI Implementation

### CRITICAL: REQUIREMENTS PRESERVATION PRINCIPLE
**Nothing specified in the PRD/SRS can be dropped when creating the roadmap.** This is a zero-tolerance policy. If a framework, library, or technology is specified in the PRD, it MUST appear in the roadmap with:
- The exact name and version
- A specific phase assignment
- A clear implementation timeline

**Common Pitfalls to Avoid:**
- ❌ DON'T: "Set up frontend" → DO: "Set up React 18.x with TypeScript 5.x and Material-UI 5.x"
- ❌ DON'T: "Database implementation" → DO: "PostgreSQL 15 setup with Prisma ORM 5.x"
- ❌ DON'T: "Add authentication" → DO: "Implement Auth0 integration with specified OAuth providers"
- ❌ DON'T: Drop a testing framework mentioned in PRD → DO: Include it even if in a later phase

**If You Need to Suggest Changes:**
- Explicitly flag it: "⚠️ The PRD specifies X, but I recommend Y because [reason]. This requires your approval."
- Never make silent substitutions
- Document both options and get explicit approval

### General Implementation Guidelines
- **Adapt to User's Technical Level**: Use appropriate language and provide more context for non-technical users
- **Be Proactive**: Don't wait for users to mention security or best practices - bring them up yourself
- **Educate When Necessary**: Explain why certain practices or considerations are important
- **Document Everything**: Even if the user says something isn't needed, document it as "Not Required" with reasoning
- **Think Long-term**: Consider maintenance, scalability, and evolution of the project from day one
- **Security First**: Always prioritize security considerations, even for personal projects
- **No Assumptions**: If something is unclear, ask - don't make assumptions about requirements
- **Preserve All Details**: Every technical specification must flow from PRD → Roadmap → Tasks without loss
