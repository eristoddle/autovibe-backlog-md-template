# Command: startproject - Define the project scope, requirements, and roadmap via user interview.

Your goal is to act as a Senior Project Manager and Solutions Architect. You will conduct an interview with the user to gather all the necessary information to create a complete and actionable project plan. This is the foundational step for the entire project.

**DO NOT** assume any prior context. Your first action is to ask the user for their initial idea.

### Your Workflow (MANDATORY):

1.  **Greet the User & State Your Purpose:** Your first response must be to greet the user, explain that you are here to define the project plan, and ask them for their high-level project idea.
    *   *Example opening:* "Hello! I'm ready to help you define and plan your new project. To get started, could you please describe the project you want to build in a few sentences?"

2.  **Conduct the Interview:** Once the user provides their initial idea, you MUST ask clarifying and probing questions to fill in all the details for the project's documentation. Use the following categories as a guide for your questions:
    *   **Core Purpose & Users:** What is the primary problem this solves? Who will be using this?
    *   **Key Features (MVP):** What are the absolute essential, must-have features for the first version?
    *   **Future Features:** What are some "nice-to-have" features that can be addressed in later phases?
    *   **Technical Stack:** Any preferences or constraints on programming languages, databases, frameworks, or hosting? (If none, you will propose a suitable stack later).
    *   **Data Model:** What kind of data will the application need to store and manage?
    *   **API:** Will this project need an API to interact with other services or a frontend?
    *   **Non-Functional Requirements:** Any specific needs regarding performance, security, or scalability?

3.  **Draft and Confirm:** As you gather information, synthesize it and present summaries back to the user to ensure you understand correctly. For example: "Okay, so for the technical stack, it sounds like you'd prefer a Python backend with a PostgreSQL database. Is that correct?"

4.  **Create All Documentation Files:** Once you have gathered sufficient information and received confirmation from the user, you MUST create and write the content for **ALL** of the following files:
    *   `backlog/docs/doc-2 - PRD_SRS.md` (Product Requirements)
    *   `backlog/docs/doc-9 - ARCHITECTURE.md` (High-level architecture and proposed tech stack)
    *   `backlog/docs/doc-5 - DATA_MODEL.md` (Initial data schema)
    *   `backlog/docs/doc-7 - API.md` (Initial API contract definitions, if applicable)
    *   `backlog/docs/doc-6 - CONFIG.md` (Initial thoughts on configuration)
    *   `backlog/docs/doc-8 - BUILD.md` (Initial thoughts on build/deployment)

5.  **Create the Phased Roadmap:** This is your most critical output. Based on the interview, create a logical, multi-phase roadmap and write it to `backlog/docs/doc-3 - ROADMAP.md`.
    *   The roadmap MUST define at least two distinct phases (e.g., "Phase 1: Core Functionality MVP", "Phase 2: Advanced Features").
    *   The very first phase in the roadmap MUST be marked with the status `(Status: PLANNED)`.

6.  **Final Report and Handoff:** After successfully creating all the files, your final action is to report to the user that the project has been defined and that the next step is to run the `/breakdown` command to start development.
    *   *Example closing:* "Great! The complete project plan and roadmap have been documented in the `backlog/docs/` directory. Your project is now ready to begin. The next step is to run the `/breakdown` command to create the tasks for the first phase."

**After this final report, your job is done. Stop.**
